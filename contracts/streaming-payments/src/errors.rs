//! Error types for StreamPay.
//!
//! Every expected failure is expressed as a [`StreamError`] variant with a
//! stable numeric code, so clients can branch on failures without parsing
//! strings. The contract never panics on expected failure paths: all public
//! entrypoints return `Result<_, StreamError>` and all arithmetic is checked.
//!
//! Codes are part of the public interface — never renumber or reuse a variant;
//! only append new ones at the bottom with the next free code. A variant that
//! turns out to be unreachable is *retired* (kept, documented, and excluded
//! from coverage in `surface.rs`) rather than removed or reused, so the wire
//! codes of every existing client stay valid forever.
//!
//! Token-side failures are always translated into one of the `*TransferFailed`
//! variants below. A token contract's own error numbers live in the same
//! `Error(Contract, #N)` namespace as this enum's codes, so letting a raw
//! token failure surface would let — say — a token's `#5` masquerade as
//! [`StreamError::StreamNotActive`] in clients. The contract therefore invokes
//! every token transfer through the SDK's fallible (`try_`) client and maps
//! any failure to a distinct StreamPay code; the original token error is
//! intentionally not propagated.
//!
//! [`StreamError::ALL`] mirrors the variant set for the generated error-surface
//! coverage test. The exhaustive match in
//! `error_surface_test::stream_error_variant_list_is_exhaustive` fails to
//! compile when a variant is added, forcing the author to extend `ALL` (and the
//! `Branch` registry) in the same change.
