#![no_std]

//! StreamPay: continuous, linear streaming payments for Stellar (Soroban).
//!
//! Lock a deposit and let it accrue to a recipient per second between
//! `start_time` and `end_time` — for payroll, DAO contributor pay,
//! subscriptions, or vesting. The recipient withdraws accrued funds at any
//! time; the sender can top up or cancel with a fair pro-rata refund.
//!
//! # Entry points
//!
//! - [`StreamingPayments::create_stream`] — open a stream and pull the deposit
//! - [`StreamingPayments::create_streams`] — atomically create a batch of streams
//! - [`StreamingPayments::withdraw`] — recipient claims accrued funds
//! - [`StreamingPayments::withdraw_max`] — recipient claims *all* accrued
//!   funds in one atomic call
//! - [`StreamingPayments::cancel_stream`] — sender (or recipient, if the
//!   stream is `cancelable`) closes the stream with a pro-rata split
//! - [`StreamingPayments::top_up`] — add funds to a running stream
//! - [`StreamingPayments::raise_dispute`] — recipient flags the stream
//!   (wrong address, coerced creation) for a bond; cancel/top-up are frozen
//!   until the sender resolves or the timelock expires
//! - [`StreamingPayments::resolve_dispute`] — sender accepts (unwind +
//!   refund bond) or rejects as bad-faith (bond slashed, stream resumes)
//! - [`StreamingPayments::expire_dispute`] — anyone, after the timelock:
//!   bond split, stream resumes
//! - [`StreamingPayments::propose_ownership_transfer`] /
//!   [`StreamingPayments::accept_ownership_transfer`] /
//!   [`StreamingPayments::cancel_ownership_transfer`] — two-step handoff of
//!   the sender (payer) or recipient (claimant) role
//! - [`StreamingPayments::propose_rate_change`] /
//!   [`StreamingPayments::accept_rate_change`] /
//!   [`StreamingPayments::cancel_rate_change`] — two-step renegotiation of the
//!   streaming rate, rebalancing the deposit at acceptance so neither party can
//!   change what is owed alone
//! - [`StreamingPayments::sponsored_withdraw`] — an operator relays a
//!   recipient’s claim and a sponsor absorbs the gas, guarded by a budget
//!   ledger and nonce replay protection (see the `sponsor` module docs)
//! - [`StreamingPayments::register_sponsor`] /
//!   [`StreamingPayments::enroll_beneficiary`] /
//!   [`StreamingPayments::rotate_operator_key`] — sponsorship setup
//! - [`StreamingPayments::get_stream`] / [`StreamingPayments::available`] /
//!   [`StreamingPayments::pending_ownership_transfer`] — read-only views
//! - [`StreamingPayments::get_dispute`] /
//!   [`StreamingPayments::required_dispute_bond`] — dispute read-only views
//! - [`StreamingPayments::recipient_streams`] /
//!   [`StreamingPayments::sender_streams`] — paginated on-chain discovery
//!   indexes per address
//! - [`StreamingPayments::treasury_status`] /
//!   [`StreamingPayments::stream_fee`] / [`StreamingPayments::verify_treasury`] —
//!   open verification reads for the protocol-fee ledger (see `treasury.rs`)
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - `0 <= withdrawn <= streamed <= deposit` for every stored stream.
//! - The contract's token balance always covers `sum(deposit - withdrawn)`
//!   over live (non-cancelled) streams, plus all outstanding dispute bonds,
//!   plus `charged_total - withdrawn_total` over all token treasuries (funds
//!   are only ever moved by these entry points; a cancelled stream holds
//!   nothing once its split was paid).
//! - All state changes happen *before* token transfers (checks-effects-
//!   interactions), so reentrant token callbacks cannot over-withdraw.
//! - Every token call goes through the SDK's fallible (`try_`) client and a
//!   failure is re-raised as a distinct `StreamError` transfer-failure code
//!   (18–22). Token contract errors share the `Error(Contract, #N)` namespace
//!   with this contract's codes, so propagating them raw would let a token's
//!   own code masquerade as a StreamPay code in clients. Because the failure
//!   is still returned as `Err`, the whole invocation — including any effects
//!   written before the transfer — rolls back atomically.
//! - `treasury.charged_total == sum of FeeCharged events == sum of stored
//!   per-stream fees`, provable from public reads (see `treasury.rs`).
//! - A dispute freezes cancel/top-up only: accrual keeps running and the
//!   recipient can always withdraw accrued funds, dispute or not.
