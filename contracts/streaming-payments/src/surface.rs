//! Error-surface instrumentation.
//!
//! Every expected failure in the contract funnels through [`reject`]: a
//! rejection site names a [`Branch`] — one `(entrypoint, condition)` validation
//! decision — instead of returning a bare [`StreamError`]. The branch registry
//! is the single source of truth for the mapping
//! `(entrypoint, condition) -> error code`, so that:
//!
//! * the generated test matrix (`error_surface_test.rs`) can prove that every
//!   *reachable* branch fires its declared code, and
//! * `docs/ERROR_SURFACE.md` is generated from the same table (see
//!   `examples/error_surface_doc.rs`) and diffed in CI.
//!
//! Because the table is data, a hand-maintained list of "which test covers
//! which code" never exists: the mapping is emitted from here.
//!
//! Instrumentation is test-only. In non-test builds [`reject`] compiles down to
//! the error it returns (the `#[cfg(test)]` trace is the only overhead, and it
//! disappears entirely in the Wasm build).
